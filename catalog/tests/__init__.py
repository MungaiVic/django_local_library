#The __init__.py should be an empty file (this tells Python that the directory is a package).
# The skeleton test file /catalog/tests.py was created automatically when we built the Django skeleton website.
# It is perfectly "legal" to put all your tests inside it, but if you test properly, you'll quickly end up with a very
# large and unmanageable test file.

# Delete the skeleton file as we won't need it.
